concept testing worked 

This project builds a smart bridge between AI tools and microservices using Dapr and a lightweight MCP Gateway, so services can automatically become AI-callable without manual setup. Each microservice (like MathService) exposes its normal business APIs and also a special /__tools endpoint that clearly explains what actions it supports and what inputs they need. When an AI client (such as Claude) asks for available tools, the MCP Gateway uses Dapr to discover running services and call their /__tools endpoints, then combines and returns these as MCP tools the AI can understand. When the AI actually calls a tool, it sends a request to the gateway, the gateway forwards that request through Dapr to the correct service endpoint, and then sends the service’s response back to the AI. In simple terms, Dapr takes care of finding and calling services, each service describes its own capabilities, and the gateway translates between AI requests and service APIs—so adding a new service automatically adds a new AI tool with no gateway changes.


If you add a new tool to the MathService (for example, a squareroot endpoint), you only need to do two things: first, add the new business endpoint (like /squareroot) and update the /__tools endpoint in the MathService to describe this new tool (its name, inputs, and purpose). Second, restart the MathService with Dapr and restart the MCP Gateway using dotnet run. After that, the gateway will automatically call the updated /__tools endpoint through Dapr, discover the new squareroot tool, and expose it to the AI. As a result, Claude will immediately see squareroot listed as an available tool and be able to call it—without any changes to the MCP Gateway code or manual tool registration.



mcpgateway run command:
dotnet run

MathService run command:
dapr run   --app-id math-service   --app-port 5092   --dapr-http-port 3500   dotnet run

dapr port is fixed 3500
